# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

BaninaPRO is an invoice-tracking web app (incoming/outgoing invoices, bank transfers) for a Hungarian company. Stack: **PHP 8 + MySQL/MariaDB, no framework, no Composer, no npm, no build step**. It is deployed by uploading files to cPanel shared hosting (Apache/LiteSpeed with `.htaccess`). The UI is mobile-first (iPhone, 375 px) and supports only a light theme.

All identifiers, comments, UI text, log codes and DB columns are **in Hungarian**. Keep new code in Hungarian to match. `TELEPITES.md` is the authoritative install and user guide; it documents every feature and every version change. Update it when behavior changes. `APP_VERSION` lives in `includes/config.php`, and `TELEPITES.md` ends with a matching version line.

Glossary: `ceg` = company, `kotes` = deal/batch grouping incoming invoices, `bejovo`/`kimeno` = incoming/outgoing invoice, `szamla` = invoice, `szamlaszam` = invoice number, `utalas` = bank transfer, `reszteljesites` = partial payment, `hatralek` = outstanding balance, `BESZÁM` = free-text warehouse reference field, `naplo` = log, `mentes` = backup, `visszaallit` = restore, `jog` = permission, `szerep` = role, `be_*` = input parsing, `hiba` = error.

## Commands

There is no build, lint or test tooling, and PHP/MySQL are not installed locally on this machine. Changes are verified by deploying to a PHP 8 + MySQL host. Useful commands where PHP is available:

```sh
php -l includes/api_bejovo.php              # syntax-check a file
php -S localhost:8000                        # local dev server (WebAuthn works on localhost without HTTPS)
mysql -u root -p < sql/schema.sql            # fresh schema + initial admin (admin / BaninaPRO-2026!)
php -q cron_mentes.php                       # make a full DB backup now (the nightly cron runs this at 03:00)
php -q cron_mentes.php lista                 # list backups
php -q cron_mentes.php vissza 20260929_0300.sql   # restore (an automatic backup is taken first)
```

Set `APP_DEBUG = true` in `includes/config.php` to get detailed errors in API responses. It must be `false` in production. `includes/config.php` holds the real production DB credentials, so never copy them elsewhere.

## Architecture

### Request flow
- `index.php` renders an empty shell. It embeds an init JSON blob (`#banina-init`: user, CSRF token, settings, WebAuthn config) and loads `assets/qr.js` and `assets/app.js`, with cache-busting by `filemtime`. It sends a strict CSP (`script-src 'self'`), so there are no inline scripts and no external resources.
- `api.php` is the single JSON endpoint: `POST {"action": "...", ...}` → `{"ok": true, "adat": ..., "csrf": ...}` or `{"ok": false, "hiba", "kod", "extra"}`. It dispatches `action` to a global function **`act_<action>(array $be): array`** defined in one of `includes/api_*.php`. Before dispatch it does the following for non-public actions:
  1. checks login and CSRF;
  2. checks the role via `muvelet_jog($action)`;
  3. blocks requests while a DB restore is running (`karbantartas_aktiv`);
  4. runs a missed nightly backup if one is due (`mentes_ha_esedekes`).
- Public (no-login) actions are listed in `$nyilvanos` in `api.php`. PDOException code 23000 is translated into friendly messages by matching unique-index names (`uq_bejovo_kotes_szamlaszam`, `uq_ceg_nev`, …). Keep those names in sync if you change indexes.
- The other top-level PHP files are standalone endpoints that bootstrap the same includes:
  - `pdf.php`: print basket → A4 PDF, built by `includes/nyomtatas.php` + `includes/pdf.php`;
  - `import.php`: xlsx upload/parse;
  - `mentes_letoltes.php` / `mentes_feltoltes.php`: admin backup download/upload;
  - `cron_mentes.php`: CLI, or URL with `?kulcs=`;
  - `setup.php`: one-time installer, to be deleted after install.

### Adding an API action (checklist)
1. Write `function act_xyz(array $be): array` in the relevant `includes/api_*.php`. If it is a new file, `require_once` it in `api.php`.
2. **Add `'xyz' => 'nez'|'megj'|'ir'|'torol'|'admin'` to `MUVELET_JOGOK` in `includes/jogok.php`.** Unlisted actions default to admin-only.
3. Parse input only with the `be_*` helpers in `includes/helpers.php`. Signal user-facing errors with `hiba($msg, $kod, $extra, $http)`, which throws `ApiError`.
4. Do multi-statement writes inside `db_tx(fn)`. Use `db_row`/`db_all`/`db_val`/`db_exec` with prepared params.
5. Record two trails:
   - `naplo('MUVELET_KOD', 'details')` writes to the daily text log `LOG/YYYYMMDD.txt`, which rolls over at 03:00;
   - `audit_ir(...)` / `audit_diff(...)` (`includes/audit.php`) writes the per-record change history in the `valtozasnaplo` table, shown by the "book" button in the UI.
6. Wire the frontend: call `api('xyz', {...})` in `app.js`.

### Roles and field-level rules (`includes/jogok.php`)
Roles have levels: `admin` 4 > `irodavezeto` 3 > `rogzito` 2 > `uzletkoto` 1. Each permission needs a minimum level: `nez`/`megj` 1, `ir` 2, `torol` 3, `admin` 4.

`megj` actions (the `*_modosit` actions) can be called by everyone, so the action itself must enforce field rules:
- `megjegyzes_szabaly()`: a lower role can only *append* to a note written by someone else. The note author is tracked in `megjegyzes_irta`.
- `beszam_szabaly()`: an `uzletkoto` may set or change BESZÁM but not clear it.

The server is the source of truth. The client only hides UI using `App.user` / `jog('ir')`.

### Domain invariants
- **IDs never repeat, even after deletes.**
  - `kovetkezo_sorszam(tipus, ev, penznem)` uses the `sorszamok` table with `LAST_INSERT_ID` and must run inside a transaction.
  - A deal (kötés) code is `YYYY-CUR-000001`; its incoming invoices get `-K0001…`, from `kotesek.utolso_k` locked with `FOR UPDATE`.
  - A transfer UID is `U-CUR-YYYY-000001`; an outgoing invoice code is `YYYY-CUR-000001`. The formatters are in `helpers.php`.
- **Invoice-number uniqueness** (`includes/ids.php`) compares numbers via `norm_azonosito()` (uppercase, letters/digits only) and the `*_norm` columns:
  - an incoming number must be unique *within one kötés* (blocked, backed by a UNIQUE index); a duplicate elsewhere only gives a warning;
  - outgoing numbers are unique among outgoing invoices.
- **Status flows:**
  - incoming: `FIZETENDO → UTALASHOZ_ADVA → FIZETVE`, or `BESZAMITVA` for a negative amount, which is equivalent to paid;
  - kötés: `NYITOTT/FIZETETT`, derived from its invoices;
  - outgoing: `NYITOTT/FIZETVE`, paid by assigning a bank-statement ID;
  - utalás: `NYITOTT/UTALVA`, plus a `lezarva` lock (1.13) that freezes adding and removing invoices.
- **One currency per utalás** (HUF or EUR), enforced server-side.
- Amounts are DECIMAL, handled as 2-decimal strings (`be_osszeg`, `dec_sum`) and may be negative. Partial payments (`reszteljesitesek`) reduce the outstanding balance (`hatralek`). Lists, deadlines, comparison and search all use the balance, not the original amount.

### Frontend (`assets/app.js`, one IIFE, vanilla JS)
- A hash router: `route()` / `render()` near the end of the file map `#/bejovo/ceg/:id/kotes/:id`, `#/kimeno/ceg/:id`, `#/utalas/:id`, `#/utalasok`, `#/hataridok`, `#/osszevetes`, `#/import`, `#/admin`, `#/profil`, `#/qr/:token`, `#/regisztral/:kod` to `view*()` functions. These functions build HTML with template strings; always escape interpolated data with `esc()`.
- Clicks use **event delegation**: elements carry `data-act="name"`, and the handler is looked up in the `ACT` object. To add a button, add a `data-act` attribute plus an `ACT` entry; do not attach inline listeners.
- Client-side "baskets" persist per browser: `Kosar` (print basket → `pdf.php`), `UtalasKosar` (current transfer collector), `BankKosar` (outgoing invoices awaiting a bank ID). The floating FAB buttons appear when these baskets are non-empty.
- Session heartbeat: the page pings `ping` every `ULES_JELENLET_MP` seconds and sends `lap_zaras` (with keepalive) when the tab closes. The server expires sessions per the `ULES_*` constants (`includes/auth.php`). Heartbeats don't count as user activity.
- Design tokens are CSS variables at the top of `assets/app.css`. Animate only `transform`/`opacity`, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### No external libraries: self-written components
- `includes/pdf.php`: PDF writer with embedded TTF fonts from `assets/fonts/`.
- `includes/xlsx.php`: xlsx reader that needs no zip extension.
- `includes/webauthn.php`: passkey verification (CBOR, COSE→PEM).
- `assets/qr.js`: QR generator.
- `includes/backup.php`: pure-PHP dump/restore with no mysqldump. Before a restore it saves `…_visszaallitas_elott.sql`, then rolls back automatically on failure.

Fix bugs in these components in place; do not swap in libraries.

`includes/import.php` (~1000 lines) handles Excel import. It detects two formats: the accounting "számlanapló" export and the legacy "kötéskönyv". It fuzzy-matches companies (≥ 55 % similarity), commits in 400-row batches with one transaction per batch, and takes a backup first.

### Database and migrations
- `sql/schema.sql` is the full current schema (utf8mb4, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) and creates the initial admin.
- Schema changes ship as **incremental `sql/frissites_<version>.sql`** files that users run manually in phpMyAdmin. When you change the schema, update `schema.sql` **and** add a `frissites_X.Y.sql` file. Also add a troubleshooting row to `TELEPITES.md` §10 for the "Unknown column" error users see when they forget the migration. Nothing applies migrations automatically.
- The DB session is forced to Budapest time and strict `sql_mode` (`includes/db.php`).

### Security and privacy conventions
- `includes/`, `sql/`, `LOG/` and `DBBCKP/` each have a deny-all `.htaccess` plus an `index.php` returning 403. Keep both when adding directories.
- Every response sends `noindex` headers (search engines and AI crawlers are deliberately blocked).
- The main root `.htaccess` described in `TELEPITES.md` is **not present in this working copy**. Do not assume it is deployed from here.
- `LOG/` and `DBBCKP/` hold real production logs and DB dumps containing business data. Don't publish or paste their contents anywhere.
